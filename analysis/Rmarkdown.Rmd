## **Introduction**

Some basics of Rmarkdown. This does not entail the syntax.


## **Installation**

Rstudio has Rmarkdown pre-installed.

If not using Rstudio:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```


## **Basics**

Most of the syntax is easy.  

If you want to write plain text just type normally.
Headings can be made by using \#. Less \#s make bigger headings.

To show code that you have run, write the code in a code chunk.
Press ctrl + alt + i to create a code chunk.
(insert an image later when u learn it)

If eval=FALSE, code chunk will not be run.
If echo=FALSE, source code will not be displayed
