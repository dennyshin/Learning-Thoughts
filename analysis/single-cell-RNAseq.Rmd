## **Motivation**

Bulk-RNAseq data is suitable for many studies. But trying to determine distinct cell types, which have significant impact in phenotype, is difficult with just bulk-RNAseq. This is where single-cell RNA sequencing comes in. More specifically, this summary is focused on the computational and analytical challenges in HIGH THROUGHPUT single-cell RNA sequencing.


## **Incorporating quantitaive standards**

The article suggests using extrinsic molecules called "spike-ins". I think this is referring to the "gene signature matrix" that we obtain from our purified cell RNA sample. The article refers to "spike-in" as the control.

## **Transcript quantification and quality control**

It seems that unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are used to assist in read alignment and depth calculation. Common tools FASTQC and IGB (Integrative Genomics Browser) are still used. 

## **Obtaining biological insights**

Our input for analysis is the matrix of gene expression counts. This matrix should be normalised and statistically solid.

#### **Identification of cell type and cellular state**

The article mentions the potential study of the differentiation of cells into a specific type.

It says that PCA and hierarchical clustering methods can be applied to locate groups of different types of cells. It also mentions what I think is the gene signature matrix linear regression techinique? But it then talks about how this method can approximate a "spatial map" of the tissue which contain these cells. 

The last paragraph is talking about how we can correct for different gene expression levels that can occur in different cell cycles.


#### **Differential expression and transcript isoforms**

Identifying the important gene that marks the gene to a particular cell type. We are looking for differentially expressed genes as candidates for possible genes that could heavily influence the type of cell.
