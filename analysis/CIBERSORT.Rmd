## **Introduction**

A summary on the paper introducing CIBERSORT, a method developed to cell composition from gene expression data using computational techniques.

## **How it works**

CIBERSORT first needs to get a matrix of reference gene expression signatures. This matrix will be used to estimate the relative proportions of each cell type. CIBERSORT then uses a support vector regression (SVR) technique on our mixture (of cells) of interest to deconvulve the mixture. 

SVR is a machine learning approach that dynamically selects genes from the signature matrix when deconvulving the mixture.

CIBERSORT also gives a global p-value. It is noted that calculating the p-value for all estimates is computationally expensive.
